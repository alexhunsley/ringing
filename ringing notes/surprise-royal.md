# Learning and ringing Bristol Surpise Royal

AH July 2019

These are notes of things I'm finding useful when learning and ringing Bristol Royal.

Of course, no two people's brains are the same, and so take what you think useful from this document, and leave anything else! There are many ways to approach learning and ringing methods.

## Bristol 8 versus higher numbers

The blue lines of some of the more 'regular' methods like Cambridge extend in a pretty obvious way from Major to Royal and Maximus, and the place bell order extends in a fairly nice way too[^1].

[^1]: We extend the p.b. order for Cambridge-like methods by inserting a few numbers each time we move up a stage, e.g. for Cambridge 8 we have 2 6 7 3 4 8 5, and for Cambridge 10 we insert a 10 and 9, like this: 2 6 **10** 7 3 4 8 **9** 5. Similarly, the p.b. additions to go from Royal to Maxiumus are: 2 6 10 **11** 7 3 4 8 **12** 9 5. This pattern continues forever upwards.

However, Bristol is not so kind! 

In B10 you can see similar bits of work to B8, but they all come in a jumbled-seeming order, and some bits look backwards! (c.f. the dodge+places in 3/4 at the start of 3rd p.b.)

### Place Bell Order

In B8, the p.b. order is the _reverse_ of Plain Bob: 2 3 5 7 8 6 4. But in B10, the p.b. order is the _same_ as straight-forward Plain Bob: 2 4 6 8 10 9 7 5 3.

This discrepancy can be a great way to throw yourself off the blue line. If you're ringing B10 and keeping in mind your current place bell and your next place bell, which is always good practice, you don't want to accidentally use the B8 p.b. order!

And so it's highly recommended for the 'next place bell' in B10 to be very familiar to you, so there's no hesitation, doubt, or mistakes when you think "What's my next placebell?".

### Learning the line

There's a general technique for learning a surprise method which I like: the "mirror-chunks" method:

1. Learn the pivot bell[^2], which in B10 is the 3.

2. Learn the two place bells sandwiching what you have already learned (and note that they are a top-bottom mirror image of each other)

3. If there's any more place bells left to learn, go back to step 2.

[^2]: The _pivot bell_ is the place bell in which the blue line is mirrored around the half-lead. Similarly, the _symmetry bell_ is the place bell where the blue line is mirrored at its start (which in Bristol is the tenor).

So if you follow the above plan for B10, you will learn 3 (pivot bell), and then these place bells pairs: 

* 2 and 5
* 4 and 7
* 6 and 9
* 8 and 10

The advantages of learning the place bells in this ways are:

* you learn the PBs in mirror-pairs, which I think is easier and helps reinforce what you are learning
* at any part of learning, you know a single continuous part of the method, which you can practice recalling from start to end. For example, once you've learned 4 and 7, you already know 3, 2 and 5, and so you can practice all your knowledge so far in the correct place bell order: 7, 5, 3, 2, 4.

### Calls in Bristol Royal

Bristol Royal usually tends to have 4ths place bobs or 8ths place bobs. Check which you're doing before you ring a touch!

See the Appendix section for more details on calls.


### Linguistic shortcuts are useful

Naming little chunks of work with a word or short phrase that makes sense to you can give you a shortcut to memorisation. For example, the work  "3/4 down, fishtail on the front, 3/4 up" I give the word "volcano", because that's what it looks like to me (when you view blue line sideways).

And the stedman 6ths that comes right after the above 'volcano' is the 'lair' (because every volcano needs an evil lair next to it, right?).

So when I ring 4ths PB in B10, I just have to think 'volcano, lair' and I've got the start of it.

Hints for naming things: 

* a single word is best. If you use a phrase, the shorter the better
* comedic or outrageous words/phrases are usually more memorable. Get creative! If it helps you remember something, great.

### A hint about places near the treble

This hint applies to any surprise method:

If you make places right before or after dodging with the treble, they are made _hand, back_ (e.g. 3rds PB).

If you make places right before or after passing (but not dodging with) the treble, they are made _back, hand_ (e.g. 4ths PB).


# Appendix - Calls

## 4ths place calls

In B8, at a bob or single most of the bells repeat a lead. But in B10, most of the bells _jump forward a lead_. For example, if you were about to become 6ths PB, you become 8ths PB.

The bells about to become 2, 3 and 5 PB do exactly the same at bobs in Major and Royal: 2 and 3 are unaffected, and 4 makes the bob.
