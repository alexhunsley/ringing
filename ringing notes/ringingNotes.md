# Ringing Notes

## Bristol Royal

Place bells are in plain bob order: ```2 4 6 8 0 9 7 5 3```.
And mirror-bell pairs are like cambridge methods: ```(x, x+3)``` and ```(8, 10)```.

At a bob you *skip* a lead: ```2 -> 6```, ```4 -> 8```, etc. Compare to B8 where you repeat a lead.

In a lead, the points come at H, B, H, B.

Making places before/after passing the treble follow the rule:

* H, B if you dodge with the treble (see 4, 7 PB)
* B, H if you don't (see e.g. 5, 2 pb).

For 4ths place calls (B and S), for higher bells you are just taking a step back at backstroke then continuing the way you were going (but as the new PB, obviously).


Notice that in the method, the (strictly) point positions get gradually further away from the pivot point.
E.g. from 3rds pb:
points at 4, 4, 6, 8 (then lightning work where you pass the treble).

From 10th pb: 3, 5, 7, lightning.
