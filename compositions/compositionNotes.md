# Composition Notes

## Plain Bob Minor

I called this: https://bb.ringingworld.co.uk/comp.php?id=2268699

```
1260 Plain Bob Minor
(bW, sW, bW, sW, bH) x 5, bH
```

The basic part is 4 courses (a 240) which is effectively a H. So it comes round after 3x that, at 720 changes.

So we could ring 6x for a 1440, but that's a bit long; we exchange the final part with a H to get 1260.

## Plain Bob Minor

Attempted this on 2020-03-15 at St Mary's (a bell dropped then treble got on wrong stroke!), called 540 then bit of 720. Got 5/9 the way through whole thing.

## Cambridge Minor

Comp: https://bb.ringingworld.co.uk/comp.php?id=2270571

```
1296 Cambridge Surprise Minor
Composed by Daniel W Brady

23456	B	I	F	H
45236	–		–	–
42356	–	–		–
3 part.
Queens, 2 Tittums, 2 Kings/Whittingtons, Backrounds.
```

```
CCCC-CCCCC-CCC-
CCCC-C-C-
```

* From tenor: out make home; out in home
* From 5: in out out; home make wrong
* 18 leads per part (courses of 12 and 6 leads)
* Quite easy to keep track of which course you're in: calls are spaced out in first course, are back-to-back in second
* Note that the part end is 42356, i.e. same as a bob home
* First false after 528 changes (22 leads) (this is at the first B in part 2 - confirm)
* After 26 leads you get rounds again (confirm) (this is at lead end just before the make in part 2)


N.B. because the tenor is an affected bell, and due to the nature of the composition, if written out fully
with strictly one course per line, comp is actually as follows:

23456	B	I	F	H
34256	–		
45236           –	–
42356	–	–		–

AH attempted calling this on 2019-01-03 (band not confident enough, got 1 part done though).

## Bristol Royal

23456  W   H
45236  -   -
23456  -   -

So a two-part. Wrong part is 9 leads, home part is 7 (so 16 total, x2 = 32 leads = 32 * 40 = 1280).

Every obs bell (6 and above) does same thing both parts: they miss their own place bell (the W), and then they miss the PB before theirs (the H).
Example: the 6 misses out 6 then 4th pb in both halfs.

Reminder: calling positions are where the tenor *ends up* after the call (and not where it *would be* if the call didn't happen).
Example: Home is 10th pb. In Bristol10 at a bob, you get to 10 by skipping 8ths pb, i.e. you were at the end of 6ths pb lead and would have become 8th pb. Similarly, home is 9th pb, so you skip 10 to get to it, so call is at end of 8th pb.
