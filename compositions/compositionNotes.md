# Composition Notes

## Plain Bob Minor

https://bb.ringingworld.co.uk/comp.php?id=2268699

```
1260 Plain Bob Minor
(bW, sW, bW, sW, bH) x 5, bH
```

The basic part is 4 courses (a 240) which is effectively a H. So it comes round after 3x that, at 720 changes.

So we could ring 6x for a 1440, but that's a bit long; we exchange the final part with a H to get 1260.

1296 Cambridge Surprise Minor
Composed by Daniel W Brady

23456	B	I	F	H
45236	–		–	–
42356	–	–		–
3 part.
Queens, 2 Tittums, 2 Kings/Whittingtons, Backrounds.
```

```
CCCC-CCCCC-CCC-

```

* From tenor: out make home; out in home
* From 5: in out out; home make wrong
* 18 leads per part (courses of 12 and 6 leads)
* Quite easy to keep track of which course you're in: calls are spaced out in first course, are back-to-back in second
* Note that the part end is 42356, i.e. same as a bob home
* First false after 528 changes (22 leads) (this is at the first B in part 2 - confirm)
* After 26 leads you get rounds again (confirm) (this is at lead end just before the make in part 2)


N.B. because the tenor is an affected bell, and due to the nature of the composition, if written out fully
with strictly one course per line, comp is actually as follows:

23456	B	I	F	H
34256	–		
45236           –	–
42356	–	–		–

AH attempted calling this on 2019-01-03 (band not confident enough, got 1 part done though).
